Background and Origins: Begin by establishing the artist's background. Include details such as their place of birth or origin, any significant early life experiences that shaped their artistic path, and how these elements contribute to their identity as an artist. Be specific but concise.

Artistic Philosophy and Core Beliefs: Articulate the artist's underlying artistic philosophy. What are their core beliefs about creativity, music, and their role as an artist? If possible, subtly weave in a representative quote or statement that encapsulates their artistic ideals. Focus on the 'why' behind their art.

Musical Style and Key Works: Describe the artist's musical style in a way that is both informative and appealing to new listeners. Provide concrete examples of their notable musical works. Mention specific tracks, EPs, or albums that exemplify their style or represent milestones in their career. Include examples of collaborations with other artists if relevant, highlighting the diversity of their musical engagements.

Online Presence and Audience Engagement: Summarize how the artist connects with their audience online. Mention their official website and key social media platforms they utilize. Describe the nature of their online engagement â€“ is it resource-focused, personal, community-building, or primarily for music promotion? Be specific about the type of presence they maintain.

Overall Tone and Style: Maintain a professional and informative tone throughout the bio. While factual, the writing should also be engaging and slightly inspiring, aiming to pique the interest of readers who are new to the artist's work. Ensure the bio flows smoothly and reads as a cohesive narrative, rather than a collection of bullet points. Make sure that the bio is readable in less than 10 seconds`
